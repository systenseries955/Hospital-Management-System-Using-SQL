# Hospital-Management-System-Using-SQL

🚑 Hospital Management System using SQL – Project Showcase 🏥

I’m excited to share my recent project: a Hospital Management System (HMS) using SQL, designed to manage critical hospital data efficiently, including patients, physicians, nurses, procedures, departments, appointments, diagnoses, and billing.

As part of this project, I solved 24 SQL queries covering real-world hospital scenarios:

Retrieving patient details based on IDs, diagnosis, or name patterns

Listing physicians by department, affiliation, or position

Mapping patients to primary treating physicians with diagnoses and prescriptions

Analyzing medical procedures to find maximum, minimum, and average costs

Performing data updates, deletions, and table modifications

Generating insights on nurses, physicians, and department heads

This project strengthened my hands-on experience with SQL joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, and data manipulation, while simulating realistic hospital workflows.

It’s amazing to see how structured queries can transform complex hospital data into actionable insights, supporting efficient patient care, resource management, and decision-making.

💡 Key skills demonstrated: Database Design, SQL Query Writing, Data Analysis, Healthcare IT, Problem-Solving

I’m looking forward to applying these skills in real-world projects to improve operational efficiency and data-driven decision-making in healthcare.
